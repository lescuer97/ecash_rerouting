# Out off band lightning routing
Experimental technology to fund a lightning payment with ecash. 

The basic idea is leveraging the relative trust a node has with it's own channel partners and mutual trust in a cashu
mint. 


# The Problem 

Nodes have a very limited capability when it comes to routing payments. It all dependens on how many sats are in their
side of a lightning channel at the time of routing. This can be a problem specially for routing nodes as they could
encounter the problem of not having enough sats to route a payment.
